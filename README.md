# Web Dev Projects
GitHub repo for my small and simple web applications. These projects are a way for me to learn more about web dev and build my portfolio over time. The idea is to build many small web apps with different functionality and technologies. The bare minimum for every application is good functionality, basic responsiveness and simple "material" design. 

There are many libraries/frameworks/technologies I want to explore and play with, for example [Electron](https://electronjs.org), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) or [three.js](https://threejs.org). I am currently using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) for dev-server and hot-reloading. This article will be expanded as I create and finish more projects.
## JS libraries to explore
- [SVG.js](https://svgjs.dev)
- [three.js](https://threejs.org)
- [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3)

I also have (not so active) [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UC3Ud-TZmDAyBoIXm1SkMnAw) about **Mechanical Engineering**, **3D Graphics** and **Programming**. Other accounts: [CodePen](https://codepen.io/trolobezka), [CSSBattle](https://cssbattle.dev/player/LT4HY2VOGtbOs47z5FrHvDRfnJO2), [personal web page](https://users.fs.cvut.cz/richard.kokstein) from my university (WIP).
